            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Benjamin. I am a student from the IMC Krems University. I study Informatics there. Also, I
                come from Hungary. I go back and forth between Austria and Hungary by train. I actually did some part of
                this webpage on the train itself. It is not the optimal place to work, but I cannot waste time.</p>
            <p>I used to play ice hockey for some years; I sometimes miss it, but it would be hard to play because of
                the university. Since I stopped ice hockey, I have been looking for other activites to do. I really wish
                to climb mountains someday. I have never done it, but I really want to try it.</p>
            <p>I have a lot of different interest. I like computer science, physics, mathematics, history, and
                philosophy. My coolest hobby is astrophotogrpahy. I used to take pictures of the planets and the Moon
                with my own telescope. Nowdays I do more computer stuff because I have less time, and also the planets
                are not visible now from my balcony.</p>
            <p>One very important fact about me is that I have a french bulldog.</p>
