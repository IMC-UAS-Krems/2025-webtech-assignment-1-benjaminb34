            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Benjamin. I am a student at IMC Krems University, where I study Informatics. I come from
                Hungary and often travel back and forth between Austria and Hungary by train. I actually created part of
                this webpage on the train itself. Not the most comfortable place to work, but I didn’t want to waste
                time!</p>
            <p>I used to play ice hockey for several years. I sometimes miss it, but it’s difficult to keep up with the
                sport while studying at university. Since I stopped playing, I’ve been looking for other activities to
                do. One of my dreams is to climb mountains someday. I’ve never done it before, but I really want to try.
            </p>
            <p>I have a lot of different interests. I enjoy computer science, physics, mathematics, history, and
                philosophy. My coolest hobby is astrophotography. I used to take pictures of the planets and the Moon
                with my own telescope. Nowadays, I do more computer-related projects because I have less time, and the
                planets aren’t visible from my balcony right now.</p>
            <p>And one very important fact about me, I have a French Bulldog.</p>
