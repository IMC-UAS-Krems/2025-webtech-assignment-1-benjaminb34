            <h2>WELCOME TO MY WEBPAGE!</h2>
            <p>This is webpage has been made for the Web Technologies class at IMC Krems University in October, 2025.
                Since this is my first functional
                webpage, it has historical significance. I am 100% sure it will be fun to explore again when I
                rediscover this someday in the far future.</p>
            <p>Feel free to inspect the html and css code to see how I have built and styled my webpage. For the most
                part, this webpage has been built using the sources that were in the lecture slides (for example the
                grid and flex templates). The webpage is not professional, and the code is messy, but I hope that you
                will still enjoy it.</p>
